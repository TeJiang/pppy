This is a python package for planetary photometry study

I am planning to write a python package for planetary photometry study.
The features include:
- Provide several classical photometric models, e.g., Hapke model, Lumme-Bowell model, Shkuratov model, etc. Give the initial parameters, and required geometry, return corresponding reflectance value.
- Provide a function read in the lab measurement data (signal value and corresponding geometry), do a classical calibration process, return the reflectance value.
- With the reflectance value in the lab and the photometric models, user can do a fitting to retrave the model parameters for further interpretation.
- Provide a nice GUI window, user can easily visulize their data/model, either for playing with the model to learn or for academic usage.

This is just started, let me know if you are interested to join me. I think more people joined/used, this project will be more useful.
